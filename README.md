# Dynamically Add or Remove Input Fields in PHP, Ajax, JQuery, SQLite and BS 5

Very basic example for a class project. Will need to use some type of server that supports PHP. The /inc folder should be writable, the SQLite database is stored in the /inc folder. The SQLite database is automatically created when saving first time.

Start by using demo-form.php and adding some items.

Visit demo-display-data.php for simple and very basic display of data from SQLite database.
